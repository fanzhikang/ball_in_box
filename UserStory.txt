User Story
=========================
 As a mathematician, I want to find the maximum value of the sum of the area of a given number of circles in a square bounded by [-1,1]. Some tiny blocks are in the square at given position. The circles can't overlap with these blocks and each other. So that I can verify the accuracy of my calculations with the area result.

Break down user story:
 1.I want find a value of the sum of areas of some given circles, which can be set in a square bounded by [-1,1] with some tiny blocks in there.
 2.I want find the maximum of the value.
 3.I want find the maximum value with different blocks in there.

Tasks:
 1.Set a square with different blocks, square bounded by [-1,1].User can define the position of the blocks.
 2.Let users set the number of balls.
 3.Use algorithm to calculate the position and the radius of these balls.
 4.Validate these balls.
 5.Calculate these balls' area sum.
